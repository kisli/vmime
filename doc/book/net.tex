\chapter{Working with Messaging Services}

% ============================================================================
\section{Introduction}

In addition to parsing and building MIME messages, VMime also offers a lot of
features to work with messaging services. This includes connecting to remote
messaging stores (like IMAP or POP3), local stores (maildir) and transport
services (send messages over SMTP or local sendmail), through an unified
interface (see Figure \ref{uml_messaging_module}). That means that you can
use independently IMAP of POP3 without having to change any line of code.

Source code of {\vexample Example6} covers all features presented in this
chapter, so it is important you take some time to read it.

\begin{figure}
	\center\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]
		{images/messaging-services.png}
	\caption{Overall structure of the messaging module}
	\label{uml_messaging_module}
\end{figure}

The interface is composed of five classes:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\vcode vmime::net::service}: this is the base interface for a
messaging service. It can be either a store service or a transport
service.

\item {\vcode vmime::net::serviceFactory}: create instances of a service.
This is used internally by the session object (see below).

\item {\vcode vmime::net::store}: interface for a store service. A store
service offers access to a set of folders containing messages. This is
used for IMAP, POP3 and maildir.

\item {\vcode vmime::net::transport}: interface for a transport service.
A transport service is capable of sending messages. This is used for
SMTP and sendmail.

\item {\vcode vmime::net::session}: a session object is used to store the
parameters used by a service (eg. connection parameters). Each service
instance is associated with only one session. The session object is capable
of creating instances of services.
\end{itemize}

The following classes are specific to store services:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\vcode vmime::net::folder}: a folder can either contain other folders
or messages, or both.

\item {\vcode vmime::net::message}: this is the interface for dealing with
messages. For a given message, you can have access to its flags, its MIME
structure and you can also extract the whole message data or given parts (if
supported by the underlying protocol).
\end{itemize}


% ============================================================================
\section{Working with sessions}

\subsection{Setting properties} % --------------------------------------------

Sessions are used to store configuration parameters for services. They
contains a set of typed properties that can modify the behaviour of the
services. Before using a messaging service, you must create and
initialize a session object:

\begin{lstlisting}
vmime::ref <net::session> theSession = vmime::create <net::session>();
\end{lstlisting}

Session properties include:

\begin{itemize}
\item connection parameters: host and port to connect to;
\item authentication parameters: user credentials required to use the
service (if any);
\item protocol-specific parameters: enable or disable extensions (eg. APOP
support in POP3).
\end{itemize}

Properties are stored using a dotted notation, to specify the service type,
the protocol name, the category and the name of the property:

\begin{verbatim}
   {service_type}.{protocol}.category.name
\end{verbatim}

An example of property is \emph{store.pop3.options.apop} (used to enable or
disable the use of APOP authentication). The \emph{store.pop3} part is called
the \emph{prefix}. This allow specifying different values for the same
property depending on the protocol used.

The session properties are stored in a {\vcode vmime::propertySet} object.
To set the value of a property, you can use either:

\begin{lstlisting}
theSession->getProperties().setProperty("property-name", value);
\end{lstlisting}

or:

\begin{lstlisting}
theSession->getProperties()["property-name"] = value;
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Available properties} % ------------------------------------------

Following is a list of available properties and the protocols they apply to,
as the time of writing this documentation\footnote{You can get an up-to-date
list of the properties by running \vexample{Example7}}. For better clarity,
the prefixes do not appear in this table.

\end{tabularx}
\caption{Protocol-specific options}
\end{table}


\subsection{Instanciating services} % ----------------------------------------

You can create a service either by specifying its protocol name, or by
specifying the URL of the service. Creation by name is deprecated so
this chapter only presents the latter option.

The URL scheme for connecting to services is:

\begin{verbatim}
   protocol://[username[:password]@]host[:port]/[root-path]
\end{verbatim}

\vnote{For local services (ie. \emph{sendmail} and \emph{maildir}), the host
part is not used, but it must not be empty (you can use "localhost").}

The following table shows an example URL for each service:

\noindent\begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{|c|X|}
\hline
	{\bf Service} &
	{\bf Connection URL} \\
\hline
imap, imaps & {\tt imap://imap.example.com},
{\tt imaps://vincent:pass@example.com} \\
\hline
pop3, pop3s & {\tt pop3://pop3.example.com} \\
\hline
smtp, smtps & {\tt smtp://smtp.example.com} \\
\hline
maildir & {\tt maildir://localhost/home/vincent/Mail} (host not used) \\
\hline
sendmail & {\tt sendmail://localhost} (host not used, always localhost) \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\newpage

When you have the connection URL, instanciating the service is quite simple.
Depending on the type of service, you will use either {\vcode getStore()} or
{\vcode getTransport()}. For example, for store services, use:

\begin{lstlisting}
vmime::utility:url url("imap://user:pass@imap.example.com");
vmime::ref <vmime::net::store> st = sess->getStore(url);
\end{lstlisting}

and for transport services:

\begin{lstlisting}
vmime::utility:url url("smtp://smtp.example.com");
vmime::ref <vmime::net::transport> tr = sess->getTransport(url);
\end{lstlisting}


% ============================================================================
\section{User credentials and authenticators}

Some services need some user credentials (eg. username and password) to open
a session. In VMime, user credentials can be specified in the session
properties or by using a custom authenticator (callback).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Setting user credentials using session
properties}]
vmime::ref <vmime::net::session> sess;  // Suppose we have a session

sess->getProperties()["store.imap.auth.username"] = "vincent";
sess->getProperties()["store.imap.auth.password"] = "my-password";
\end{lstlisting}

Although not recommended, you can also specify username and password
directly in the connection URL,
ie: \emph{imap://username:password@imap.example.com/}. This works only for
services requiring an username and a password as user credentials, and no
other information.

Sometimes, it may not be very convenient to set username/password in the
session properties, or not possible (eg. extended SASL mechanisms) . That's
why VMime offers an alternate way of getting user credentials: the
{\vcode authenticator} object. Basically, an authenticator is an object that
can return user credentials on-demand (like a callback).

Currently, there are two types of authenticator in VMime: a basic
authenticator (class {\vcode vmime::security::authenticator}) and, if SASL
support is enabled, a SASL authenticator
(class {\vcode vmime::security::sasl::SASLAuthenticator}). Usually, you
should use the default implementations, or at least make your own
implementation inherit from them.

The following example shows how to use a custom authenticator to request
the user to enter her/his credentials:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={A simple interactive authenticator}]
class myAuthenticator : public vmime::security::defaultAuthenticator
{
   const string getUsername() const
   {
      std::cout << "Enter your username: " << std::endl;

      vmime::string res;
      std::getline(std::cin, res);

      return res;
   }

   const string getPassword() const
   {
      std::cout << "Enter your password: " << std::endl;

      vmime::string res;
      std::getline(std::cin, res);

      return res;
   }
};
\end{lstlisting}

This is how to use it:

\begin{lstlisting}
// First, create a session
vmime::ref <vmime::net::session> sess =
   vmime::create <vmime::net::session>();

// Next, initialize a service which will use our authenticator
vmime::ref <vmime::net::store> st =
   sess->getStore(vmime::utility::url("imap://imap.example.com"),
      /* use our authenticator */ vmime::create <myAuthenticator>());
\end{lstlisting}

\vnote{An authenticator object should be used with one and only one service
at a time. This is required because the authentication process may need to
retrieve the service name (SASL).}

Of course, this example is quite simplified. For example, if several
authentication mechanisms are tried, the user may be requested to enter the
same information multiple times. See  {\vexample Example6} for a more complex
implementation of an authenticator, with caching support.

If you want to use SASL (ie. if \emph{options.sasl} is set to \emph{true}),
your authenticator must inherit from
{\vcode vmime::security::sasl::SASLAuthenticator} or
{\vcode vmime::security::sasl::defaultSASLAuthenticator}, even if you do not
use the SASL-specific methods {\vcode getAcceptableMechanisms()} and
{\vcode setSASLMechanism()}. Have a look at {\vexample Example6} to see an
implementation of an SASL authenticator.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={A simple SASL authenticator}]
class mySASLAuthenticator : public vmime::security::sasl::defaultSASLAuthenticator
{
   typedef vmime::security::sasl::SASLMechanism mechanism;  // save us typing

   const std::vector <vmime::ref <mechanism > getAcceptableMechanisms
         (const std::vector <vmime::ref <mechanism> >& available,
          vmime::ref <mechanism> suggested) const
   {
      // Here, you can sort the SASL mechanisms in the order they will be
      // tried. If no SASL mechanism is acceptable (ie. for example, not
      // enough secure), you can return an empty list.
      //
      // If you do not want to bother with this, you can simply return
      // the default list, which is ordered by security strength.
      return defaultSASLAuthenticator::
         getAcceptableMechanisms(available, suggested);
   }

   void setSASLMechanism(vmime::ref <mechanism> mech)
   {
      // This is called when the authentication process is going to
      // try the specified mechanism.
      //
      // The mechanism name is in mech->getName()

      defaultSASLAuthenticator::setSASLMechanism(mech);
   }

   // ...implement getUsername() and getPassword()...
};
\end{lstlisting}


% ============================================================================
\section{Using transport service}

You have two possibilities for giving message data to the service when you
want to send a message:

\begin{itemize}
\item either you have a reference to a message (type {\vcode vmime::message})
and you can simply call {\vcode send(msg)};
\item or you only have raw message data (as a string, for example), and you
have to call the second overload of {\vcode send()}, which takes additional
parameters (corresponding to message envelope);
\end{itemize}

The following example illustrates the use of a transport service to send a
message using the second method:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Using a transport service}]
const vmime::string msgData =
   "From: me@example.org \r\n"
   "To: you@example.org \r\n"
   "Date: Sun, Oct 30 2005 17:06:42 +0200 \r\n"
   "Subject: Test \r\n"
   "\r\n"
   "Message body";

// Create a new session
vmime::utility::url url("smtp://example.com");

vmime::ref <vmime::net::session> sess =
   vmime::create <vmime::net::session>();

// Create an instance of the transport service
vmime::ref <vmime::net::transport> tr = sess->getTransport(url);

// Connect it
tr->connect();

// Send the message
vmime::utility::inputStreamStringAdapter is(msgData);

vmime::mailbox from("me@example.org");
vmime::mailboxList to;
to.appendMailbox(vmime::create <vmime::mailbox>("you@example.org"));

tr->send(
   /* expeditor */    from,
   /* recipient(s) */ to,
   /* data */         is,
   /* total length */ msgData.length());

// We have finished using the service
tr->disconnect();
\end{lstlisting}

\vnote{Exceptions can be thrown at any time when using a service. For better
clarity, exceptions are not caught here, but be sure to catch them in your own
application to provide error feedback to the user.}

If you use SMTP, you can enable authentication by setting some properties
on the session object ({\vcode service::setProperty()} is a shortcut for
setting properties on the session with the correct prefix):

\begin{lstlisting}
tr->setProperty("options.need-authentication", true);
tr->setProperty("auth.username", "user");
tr->setProperty("auth.password", "password");
\end{lstlisting}


% ============================================================================
\section{Using store service}

\subsection{Connecting to a store} % -----------------------------------------

The first basic step for using a store service is to connect to it. The
following example shows how to initialize a session and instanciate the
store service:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Connecting to a store service}]
// Create a new session
vmime::utility::url url("imap://vincent:password@imap:example.org");

vmime::ref <vmime::net::session> sess =
   vmime::create <vmime::net::session>();

// Create an instance of the transport service
vmime::ref <vmime::net::store> store = sess->getStore(url);

// Connect it
store->connect();
\end{lstlisting}

\vnote{{\vexample Example6} contains a more complete example for connecting
to a store service, with support for a custom authenticator.}

\subsection{Opening a folder} % ----------------------------------------------

You can open a folder using two different access modes: either in
\emph{read-only} mode (where you can only read message flags and contents), or
in \emph{read-write} mode (where you can read messages, but also delete them
or add new ones). When you have a reference to a folder, simply call the
{\vcode open()} method with the desired access mode:

\begin{lstlisting}
folder->open(vmime::net::folder::MODE_READ_WRITE);
\end{lstlisting}

\vnote{Not all stores support the \emph{read-write} mode. By default, if the
\emph{read-write} mode is not available, the folder silently fall backs on
the \emph{read-only} mode, unless the \emph{failIfModeIsNotAvailable} argument
to {\vcode open()} is set to true.}

Call {\vcode getDefaultFolder()} on the store to obtain a reference to the
default folder, which is usually the INBOX folder (where messages arrive when
they are received).

You can also open a specific folder by specifying its path. The following
example will open a folder named \emph{bar}, which is a child of \emph{foo}
in the root folder:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Opening a folder from its path}]
vmime::net::folder::path path;
path /= vmime::net::folder::path::component("foo");
path /= vmime::net::folder::path::component("bar");

vmime::ref <vmime::net::folder> fld = store->getFolder(path);
fld->open(vmime::net::folder::MODE_READ_WRITE);
\end{lstlisting}

\vnote{You can specify a path as a string as there is no way to get the
separator used to delimitate path components. Always use {\vcode operator/=}
or {\vcode appendComponent}.}

\vnote{Path components are of type {\vcode vmime::word}, which means that
VMime supports folder names with extended characters, not only 7-bit
US-ASCII. However, be careful that this may not be supported by the
underlying store protocol (IMAP supports it, because it uses internally a
modified UTF-7 encoding).}

\subsection{Fetching messages} % ---------------------------------------------

You can fetch some information about a message without having to download the
whole message. Moreover, folders support fetching for multiple messages in
a single request, for better performance. The following items are currently
available for fetching:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf envelope}: sender, recipients, date and subject;
\item {\bf structure}: MIME structure of the message;
\item {\bf content-info}: content-type of the root part;
\item {\bf flags}: message flags;
\item {\bf size}: message size;
\item {\bf header}: retrieve all the header fields of a message;
\item {\bf uid}: unique identifier of a message;
\item {\bf importance}: fetch header fields suitable for use with
{\vcode misc::importanceHelper}.
\end{itemize}

\vnote{Not all services support all fetchable items. Call
{\vcode getFetchCapabilities()} on a folder to know which information can be
fetched by a service.}

The following code shows how to list all the messages in a folder, and
retrieve basic information to show them to the user:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Fetching information about multiple messages}]
std::vector <ref <vmime::net::message> > allMessages = folder->getMessages();

folder->fetchMessages(allMessages,
   vmime::net::folder::FETCH_FLAGS |
   vmime::net::folder::FETCH_ENVELOPE);

for (unsigned int i = 0 ; i < allMessages.size() ; ++i)
{
   vmime::ref <vmime::net::message> msg = allMessages[i];

   const int flags = msg->getFlags();

   std::cout << "Message " << i << ":" << std::endl;

   if (flags & vmime::net::message::FLAG_SEEN)
      std::cout << " - is read" << std::endl;
   if (flags & vmime::net::message::FLAG_DELETED)
      std::cout << " - is deleted" << std::endl;

   vmime::ref <const vmime::header> hdr = msg->getHeader();

   std::cout << " - sent on " << hdr->Date()->generate() << std::endl;
   std::cout << " - sent by " << hdr->From()->generate() << std::endl;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Extracting messages and parts}

To extract the whole contents of a message (including headers), use the
{\vcode extract()} method on a {\vcode vmime::net::message} object. The
following example extracts the first message in the default folder:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Extracting messages}]
// Get a reference to the folder and to its first message
vmime::ref <vmime::net::folder> folder = store->getDefaultFolder();
vmime::ref <vmime::net::message> msg = folder->getMessage(1);

// Write the message contents to the standard output
vmime::utility::outputStreamAdapter out(std::cout);
msg->extract(out);
\end{lstlisting}

Some protocols (like IMAP) also support the extraction of specific MIME parts
of a message without downloading the whole message. This can save bandwidth
and time. The method {\vcode extractPart()} is used in this case:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Extracting a specific MIME part of a message}]
// Fetching structure is required before extracting a part
folder->fetchMessage(msg, vmime::net::folder::FETCH_STRUCTURE);

// Now, we can extract the part
msg->extractPart(msg->getStructure()->getPartAt(0)->getPartAt(1));
\end{lstlisting}

Suppose we have a message with the following structure:

\begin{verbatim}
   multipart/mixed
      text/html
      image/jpeg [*]
\end{verbatim}

The previous example will extract the header and body of the \emph{image/jpeg}
part.

\subsection{Deleting messages} % ---------------------------------------------

The following example will delete the second and the third message from the
store.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Deleting messages}]
vmime::ref <vmime::net::folder> folder = store->getDefaultFolder();

folder->deleteMessage(3);
folder->deleteMessage(2);

// This is equivalent
std::vector <int> nums;
nums.push_back(2);
nums.push_back(3);
folder->deleteMessages(nums);

// This is also equivalent
folder->deleteMessages(/* from */ 2, /* to */ 3);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Events} % --------------------------------------------------------

As a result of executing some operation (or from time to time, even if no
operation has been performed), a store service can send events to notify you
that something has changed (eg. the number of messages in a folder). These
events may allow you to update the user interface associated to a message
store.

Currently, there are three types of event:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf message change}: sent when the number of messages in a folder
has changed (ie. some messages have been added or removed);
\item {\bf message count change}: sent when one or more message(s) have
changed (eg. flags or deleted status);
\item {\bf folder change}: sent when a folder has been created, renamed or
deleted.
\end{itemize}

You can register a listener for each event type by using the corresponding
methods on a {\vcode folder} object: {\vcode addMessageChangedListener()},
{\vcode addMessageCountListener()} or {\vcode addFolderListener()}. For more
information, please read the class documentation for
{\vcode vmime::net::events} namespace.


% ============================================================================
\section{Handling time-outs}

Unexpected errors can occur while messaging services are performing
operations and waiting a response from the server (eg. server stops
responding, network link falls down). As all operations as synchronous,
they can be ``blocked'' a long time before returning (in fact, they loop
until they either receive a response from the server, or the underlying
socket system returns an error).

VMime provides a mechanism to control the duration of operations. This
mechanism allows the program to cancel an operation that is currently
running.

An interface called {\vcode timeoutHandler} is provided:

\begin{lstlisting}
class timeoutHandler : public object
{
   /** Called to test if the time limit has been reached.
     *
     * @return true if the time-out delay is elapsed
     */
   virtual const bool isTimeOut() = 0;

   /** Called to reset the time-out counter.
     */
   virtual void resetTimeOut() = 0;

   /** Called when the time limit has been reached (when
     * isTimeOut() returned true).
     *
     * @return true to continue (and reset the time-out)
     * or false to cancel the current operation
     */
   virtual const bool handleTimeOut() = 0;
};
\end{lstlisting}

While the operation runs, the service calls {\vcode isTimeout()} at variable
intervals. If the function returns {\vcode true}, then
{\vcode handleTimeout()} is called. If it also returns {\vcode true}, the
operation is cancelled and an {\vcode operation\_timed\_out} exception is
thrown. The function {\vcode resetTimeout()} is called each time data has
been received from the server to reset time-out delay.

The following example shows how to implement a simple time-out handler:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Implementing a simple time-out handler}]
class myTimeoutHandler : public vmime::net::timeoutHandler
{
public:

   const bool isTimeOut()
   {
      return (getTime() >= m_last + 30);  // 30 seconds time-out
   }

   void resetTimeOut()
   {
      m_last = getTime();
   }

   const bool handleTimeOut()
   {
      std::cout << "Operation timed out." << std::endl;
                << "Press [Y] to continue, or [N] to "
                << "cancel the operation." << std::endl;

      std::string response;
      std::cin >> response;

      return (response == "y" || response == "Y");
   }

private:

   const unsigned int getTime() const
   {
      return vmime::platform::getHandler()->getUnixTime();
   }

   unsigned int m_last;
};
\end{lstlisting}

To make the service use your time-out handler, you need to write a factory
class, to allow the service to create instances of the handler class. This
is required because the service can use several connections to the server
simultaneously, and each connection needs its own time-out handler.

\begin{lstlisting}
class myTimeoutHandlerFactory : public vmime::net::timeoutHandlerFactory
{
public:

   ref <timeoutHandler> create()
   {
      return vmime::create <myTimeoutHandler>();
   }
};
\end{lstlisting}

Then, call the {\vcode setTimeoutHandlerFactory()} method on the service object
to set the time-out handler factory to use during the session:

\begin{lstlisting}
theService->setTimeoutHandlerFactory(vmime::create <myTimeoutHandlerFactory>());
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Secured connection using TLS/SSL}

\subsection{Introduction} % --------------------------------------------------

If you have enabled TLS support in VMime, you can configure messaging services
so that they use a secured connection.

Quoting from RFC-2246 - the TLS 1.0 protocol specification: \emph{`` The TLS
protocol provides communications privacy over the Internet. The protocol
allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed
to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.''}

TLS has the following advantages:

\begin{itemize}
\item authentication: server identity can be verified;
\item privacy: transmission of data between client and server cannot be read
by someone in the middle of the connection;
\item integrity: original data which is transferred between a client and a
server can not be modified by an attacker without being detected.
\end{itemize}

\vnote{What is the difference between SSL and TLS? SSL is a protocol designed
by Netscape. TLS is a standard protocol, and is partly based on version 3 of
the SSL protocol. The two protocols are not interoperable, but TLS does
support a mechanism to back down to SSL 3.}

VMime offers two possibilities for using a secured connection:

\begin{itemize}
\item you can connect to a server listening on a special port (eg. IMAPS
instead of IMAP): this is the classical use of SSL, but is now deprecated;
\item connect to a server listening on the default port, and then begin a
secured connection: this is STARTTLS.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Setting up a secured connection} % -------------------------------

\subsubsection{Connecting to a ``secured'' port} % ...........................

To use the classical SSL/TLS way, simply use the ``S'' version of the protocol
to connect to the server (eg. \emph{imaps} instead of \emph{imap}). This is
currently available for SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.

\begin{lstlisting}
vmime::ref <vmime::net::store> store =
   theSession->getStore(vmime::utility::url("imaps://example.org"));
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Using STARTTLS} % .............................................

To make the service start a secured session using the STARTTLS method, simply
set the \emph{connection.tls} property:

\begin{lstlisting}
theService->setProperty("connection.tls", true);
\end{lstlisting}

\vnote{If, for some reason, a secured connection cannot be started, the
default behaviour is to fallback on a normal connection. To make
{\vcode connect()} fail if STARTTLS fails, set the
\emph{connection.tls.required} to \emph{true}.}

\subsection{Certificate verification} % --------------------------------------

\subsubsection{How it works} % ...............................................

If you tried the previous examples, a
{\vcode certificate\_verification\_exception} might have been thrown.
This is because the default certificate verifier in VMime did not manage to
verify the certificate, and so could not trust it.

Basically, when you connect to a server using TLS, the server responds with
a list of certificates, called a certificate chain (usually, certificates are
of type X.509\footnote{And VMime currently supports only X.509 certificates}).
The certificate chain is ordered so that the first certificate is the subject
certificate, the second is the subject's issuer one, the third is the issuer's
issuer, and so on.

To decide whether the server can be trusted or not, you have to verify that
\emph{each} certificate is valid (ie. is trusted). For more information
about X.509 and certificate verification, see related articles on Wikipedia
\footnote{See \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\_key\_certificate}}.

\subsubsection{Using the default certificate verifier} % .....................

The default certificate verifier maintains a list of root (CAs) and user
certificates that are trusted. By default, the list is empty. So, you have
to initialize it before using the verifier.

The algorithm\footnote{See
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification\_path\_validation\_algorithm}}
used is quite simple:

\begin{enumerate}
\item for every certificate in the chain, verify that the certificate has been
issued by the next certificate in the chain;
\item for every certificate in the chain, verify that the certificate is valid
at the current time;
\item decide whether the subject's certificate can be trusted:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item first, verify that the the last certificate in the chain was
	issued by a third-party that we trust (root CAs);
	\item if the issuer certificate cannot be verified against root CAs,
	compare the subject's certificate against the trusted certificates
	(the certificates the user has decided to trust).
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

First, we need some code to load existing X.509 certificates:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Reading a X.509 certificate from a file}]
vmime::ref <vmime::security::cert::X509Certificate>
   loadX509CertificateFromFile(const std::string& path)
{
   std::ifstream certFile;
   certFile.open(path.c_str(), std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);

   if (!certFile)
   {
      // ...handle error...
   }

   vmime::utility::inputStreamAdapter is(certFile);
   vmime::ref <vmime::security::cert::X509Certificate> cert;

   // Try DER format
   cert = vmime::security::cert::X509Certificate::import
      (is, vmime::security::cert::X509Certificate::FORMAT_DER);

   if (cert != NULL)
      return cert;

   // Try PEM format
   is.reset();
   cert = vmime::security::cert::X509Certificate::import
      (is, vmime::security::cert::X509Certificate::FORMAT_PEM);

   return cert;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Then, we can use the {\vcode loadX509CertificateFromFile} function to load
certificates and initialize the certificate verifier:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Using the default certificate verifier}]
vmime::ref <vmime::security::cert::defaultCertificateVerifier> vrf =
   vmime::create <vmime::security::cert::defaultCertificateVerifier>();

// Load root CAs (such as Verisign or Thawte)
std::vector <vmime::ref <vmime::security::cert::X509Certificate> > rootCAs;

rootCAs.push_back(loadX509CertificateFromFile("/path/to/root-ca1.cer");
rootCAs.push_back(loadX509CertificateFromFile("/path/to/root-ca2.cer");
rootCAs.push_back(loadX509CertificateFromFile("/path/to/root-ca3.cer");

vrf->setX509RootCAs(rootCAs);

// Then, load certificates that the user explicitely chose to trust
std::vector <vmime::ref <vmime::security::cert::X509Certificate> > trusted;

trusted.push_back(loadX509CertificateFromFile("/path/to/trusted-site1.cer");
trusted.push_back(loadX509CertificateFromFile("/path/to/trusted-site2.cer");

vrf->setX509TrustedCerts(trusted);
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Writing your own certificate verifier} % ......................

If you need to do more complex verifications on certificates, you will have to
write your own verifier. Your verifier should inherit from the
{\vcode vmime::security::cert::certificateVerifier} class and implement the
method {\vcode verify()}. Then, if the specified certificate chain is trusted,
simply return from the function, or else throw a
{\vcode certificate\_verification\_exception}.

The following example shows how to implement an interactive certificate
verifier which relies on the user's decision, and nothing else (you SHOULD NOT
use this in a production application as this is obviously a serious security
issue):

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={A custom certificate verifier}]
class myCertVerifier : public vmime::security::cert::certificateVerifier
{
public:

   void verify(vmime::ref <certificateChain> certs)
   {
      // Obtain the subject's certificate
      vmime::ref <vmime::security::cert::certificate> cert = chain->getAt(0);

      std::cout << std::endl;
      std::cout << "Server sent a '" << cert->getType() << "'"
         << " certificate." << std::endl;
      std::cout << "Do you want to accept this certificate? (Y/n) ";
      std::cout.flush();

      std::string answer;
      std::getline(std::cin, answer);

      if (answer.length() != 0 && (answer[0] == 'Y' || answer[0] == 'y'))
         return;  // OK, we trust the certificate

      // Don't trust this certificate
      throw exceptions::certificate_verification_exception();
   }
};
\end{lstlisting}

\vnote{In production code, it may be a good idea to remember user's decisions
about which certificates to trust and which not. See {\vexample Example6} for
a basic cache implementation.}

Finally, to make the service use your own certificate verifier, simply write:

\begin{lstlisting}
theService->setCertificateVerifier(vmime::create <myCertVerifier>());
\end{lstlisting}
